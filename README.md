# Animais Fantásticos
Final project of Origamid's Frontend ES6+ classes

# Full SPA Frontend Web App

Made with VanillaJS, html and css. This was my first and complete frontend project.
Basically an interface that implements the best of ES6+ for a good experience.

## Concepts approached while building it:
  * **Adding Event Listeners**:
    * To change content based on user interaction (by clicking in the animals images)
    * To show an alert while mouseover through map (mouseover)
    * To Scroll down to sections based on user click
    * To animate each second based on scrolldown
    * To animate numbers when user reachs the numbers section
    * To show up one alert that covers the whole change
     
  * **Connecting to APIs**: To get the bitcoin price to sponsor the "Animais Fantásticos" fictional project
  
  * Also used Observer for some features and implemented both Drodown and Mobile Menu made from 0, with Vanilla JS.
